            <li>Forcibly sterilized thousands of people<sup> 1</sup></li>
            <li>Limited immigration in fear of "inferior individual family stocks [that] are tending to deteriorate our national characteristics”<sup> 2</sup></li>

          <h3>USA!</h3>
          <p>The US is responsible for spreading many of the eugenics ideas that we now associate with Nazi Germany.</p>
          <p>While eugenics is widely thought to be a racist idea of the past, what used to be called eugenics has dispersed into many fields of science today. While few scientists would say they are eugenicists, many scientists are still practicing eugenics.</p>
          <p>We must protect one another against genetic discrimination and fight against research that seeks to divide us.</p>

          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>Eugenics is the science of controlling human mating to create a population with desired traits.</p>
          <p>There are two types of eugenics:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Positive eugenics</strong><br>Encourages people with desired traits to mate</li>
              <li><strong>Negative eugenics</strong><br>Kills or sterilizes people with undesired traits</li>

          <h3>Origins</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Plato suggested that the state should control mating to create a strong guardian class in his book <em>Republic</em><sup> 1</sup></li>
            <li>Sir Francis Galton is the father of modern eugenics, coining the term in his book <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0BdjGirCpugC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false">Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development</a></em></li>
            <li>Galton made major contributions to the field of genetics, including a basic form of twin studies - the primary tool of behavioral genetics<sup> 2</sup></li>

                <li>Founded the Eugenics Records Office in the Cold Spring National Laboratory</li>
                <li>Later founded the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Margaret Sanger, W.E.B Du Bois supported eugenics<sup> 1</sup></li>

          <h3>"Downfall" of Eugenics</h3>
          <p>After World War II, eugenics fell out of public favor. In the decades following the war, many eugenics organizations rebranded and denounced their past</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Eugenics Education Society became the Galton Institute</li>
            <li>The American Eugenics Society became Society for Biodemography and Social Biology</li>
            <li>The Eugenics Records Office shut down</li>

          <h3>Eugenics Today</h3>
          <p>Today, the research that used to be considered eugenics has now been dispersed to many fields of genetics.<br>The most important fields are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gene therapy</strong><br>Treating diseases with genetic causes</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis</strong><br>Genetic screening of zygotes before implantation</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral genetics</strong><br>Study of genes' relationship to behavior, intelligence, mental illness</li>

          <h3>Genetic Discrimination</h3>
          <p>Low cost genetic screening could lead to easily implemented genetic discrimination.</p>

          <h3>The Bell Curve</h3>
          <p><em>The Bell Curve</em> by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray is a controversial book that argued that intelligence is not influenced by education/SES and followed by statistics showing that American Blacks have a lower IQ than American Whites (implying a genetic difference)</p>
          <p>Criticisms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Motivation is racism - cited racist literature</li>
            <li>Devlin et al. - education affects IQ more than estimated in The Bell Curve</li>
            <li>APA agreed with findings, but not premise nor genetic explanation</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Pioneer Fund</h3>
          <p>The Pioneer Fund is a non-profit organization that funds scientific racism. It was founded by members of many eugenics organizations.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Funds white-nationalist journal <em>Mankind Weekly</em>'s publisher Roger Pearson<br>Many of the authors cited in <em>The Bell Curve</em> have been published in Mankind Weekly<sup> 1</sup></li>
            <li>Richard Lynn, who serves on the board of The Pioneer Fund, recently authored <em>Eugenics: A Reevaluation</em> where he argues that eugenics is good and that new genetic advances <em>are eugenics</em></li>

          <h3>What can we do?<sup> 1</sup></h3>
          <p>While the science behind eugenics may be impossible to stop, we can stop eugenics from becoming the racist genocide that it did in the early 20th century</p>
          <p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has the following tips to prevent discrimination</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fight for constitutional protections</li>
            <li>Make education more accessible</li>
            <li>Maintain multiculturalism</li>
